# Calculator-Tkinter
A scientific calculator GUI in Python using Tkinter

This was my first Python project after completing my PCAP certification. I learn't GUI with Tkinter and made this scientific calculator using :
* Frames
* Labels
* Buttons
* Menus

I have used various commands using def method in Python.

## Usage
We can open the calculator01.py file in any IDLE and just run it. It will open the GUI application..The first page has a normal calculator, however from the menu select 
scientific calculator and start using those operations as well.

Hopefully you will enjoy using it.

Any feedbacks are wellcome!

Thankyou!
